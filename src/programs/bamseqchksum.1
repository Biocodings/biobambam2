.TH BAMCAT 1 "October 2013" BIOBAMBAM
.SH NAME
bamseqchksum - produce checksums for primary data in BAM files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B bamseqchksum
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
bamseqchksum reads a BAM file from stdin, for each record calculates crc32
checksums over
.IP [1]
flags and sequence
.IP [2]
queryname, flags and sequence
.IP [3]
flags, sequence and qualities
.IP [4]
queryname, flags, sequence and qualities
.PP
where the flags are the least significant byte of the BAM FLAGS containing
only the bits for multiple segments, first segment and last segment. The
sequence is reverse complemented, and quality string reversed, before 
checksumming if the reverse complemented bit is set.
.PP
The product, modulo 2^31-1, of these checksums is taken over all
non-supplementary and non-secondary BAM alignment records. Separate 
products are reported for combinations of all and QC pass records and for each
readgroup.
.LP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B verbose=<1>:
Valid values are
.IP 1:
print progress report on standard error
.IP 0:
do not print progress report
