.SH NAME
bamsormadup - sort name collated SAM or BAM file by coordinates and mark duplicates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B bamsormadup [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
bamsormadup reads a name collated BAM or SAM file from standard input, runs a fix mate
process, sorts the contained alignments by coordinate, marks duplicate
alignments and writes the sorted alignments to standard output in BAM
format. An alignment file is name collated if all the alignments for one
read name appear consecutively in the file.
.PP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B level=<-1|0|1|9|11>:
set compression level of the output BAM file. Valid
values are
.IP -1:
zlib/gzip default compression level
.IP 0:
uncompressed
.IP 1:
zlib/gzip level 1 (fast) compression
.IP 9:
zlib/gzip level 9 (best) compression
.P
If libmaus has been compiled with support for igzip (see
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/igzip-a-high-performance-deflate-compressor-with-optimizations-for-genomic-data)
then an additional valid value is
.IP 11:
igzip compression
.PP
.B tmpfile=<filename>:
set the prefix for temporary file names
.PP
.B inputformat=<bam>: 
set the input file format.
This can be either bam or sam (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.PP
.B threads=<[1]>:
number of threads used
.PP
.B M=<stderr>: 
name of the metrics file for duplicate marking (metrics are written to standard error if not set)
.PP
.B tmpfile=<bamsormadup_hostname_pid_starttime>:
prefix for temporary files. By default the temporary files are created in the current directory.
