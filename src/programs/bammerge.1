.TH BAMMERGE 1 "October 2013" BIOBAMBAM
.SH NAME
bammerge - merge BAM files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B bammerge
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
bammerge reads a set of input BAM files, merges the contained headers and
alignment data and writes the output on standard output in BAM format. The
input files can be specified via the I key. Any none key=value arguments
given after the key=value pairs will also be considered as input files. The
input files need to be sorted by coordinate or query name. The set of
reference sequences in the files does not need to be identical. For merging
coordinate sorted files however the order of the reference sequences in the 
headers needs to be consistent among the files, i.e. if reference sequence 
A appears before reference sequence B in any input file, then this needs 
to hold for all other files as well. If the order is not consistent then
bammerge cannot be used for merging. In this case the merging can be done
by concatenating the files using bamcat and running bamsort afterwards.
.PP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B I=<stdin>: 
name of the input file. This key can be used multiple times
.PP
.B SO=<coordinate>:
Sort order. By default the sort order is coordinate.
.IP coordinate:
input files are sorted by coordinate. The created output file will be sorted by coordinate as well.
.IP queryname:
input files are sorted by query name. The created output file will be sorted by query name as well.
.PP
.B level=<-1|0|1|9>:
set compression level of the output BAM file. Default value is -1. Valid
values are
.IP -1:
zlib/gzip default compression level
.IP 0:
uncompressed
.IP 1:
zlib/gzip level 1 (fast) compression
.IP 9:
zlib/gzip level 9 (best) compression
.PP
.B verbose=<1>:
Valid values are
.IP 1:
print progress report on standard error
.IP 0:
do not print progress report
